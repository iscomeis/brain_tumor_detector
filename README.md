# Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

In the domain of medical image analysis, accurately classifying brain tumors is a critical task that can significantly aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. This project focuses on building a Deep Learning model to classify brain tumors from MRI images into four distinct categories:

- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**

To achieve this, we will utilize **VGG16**, a popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture known for its high performance in image classification tasks. By leveraging **transfer learning**, we will adapt a pre-trained VGG16 model to our specific classification problem, thus reducing training time and improving model accuracy.

The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the dataset hosted at [Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri), which provides a comprehensive collection of labeled MRI images for our analysis.
